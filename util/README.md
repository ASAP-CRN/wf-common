# util scripts

| Script | Description | Context |
| :- | :- | :- |
| [`common.py`](./common.py) | Common lists and functions used across scripts. | Ability to reuse common lists and functions. |
| [`generate_inputs`](./generate_inputs) | Generate inputs JSON for WDL pipelines. | Ability to generate the inputs JSON for WDL pipelines given a project TSV (sample information), inputs JSON template, workflow name, and cohort dataset name. |
| [`transfer_qc_metadata_and_contributed_data`](./transfer_qc_metadata_and_contributed_data) | Transfer QC'ed metadata, CRN Team contributed artifacts, and other CRN Team contributed data (e.g., spatial) from raw data buckets to staging (for Urgent/Minor releases) *or* production buckets (for Minor/Major releases). | Ability to transfer QC'ed metadata and CRN Team contributed data from raw buckets to staging/production buckets. This script is run for all releases: Urgent, Minor, and Major. It also removes the `internal-qc-data` label from the released raw buckets for Urgent/Minor releases. The rationale behind moving this type of data to production buckets (i.e., CURATED) for Urgent/Minor releases is because there are no pipeline/curated outputs, so the staging buckets are not used. The rationale behind moving this type of data to staging buckets (i.e., DEV/UAT) for Minor/Major releases is because there are pipeline/curated outputs, so the [`promote_staging_data`](./promote_staging_data) is used and will eventually copy the data over to production buckets. Minor releases are applicable to both here because sometimes datasets are only platformed in a Minor release, but there are other times where datasets are run through *existing* pipelines. **Note: this script must be run before [`promote_staging_data`](./promote_staging_data).** |
| [`promote_staging_data`](./promote_staging_data) | Promote staging data to production data buckets and apply the appropriate permissions. | Ability to run data integrity tests when trying to promote data from staging (i.e., DEV/UAT) to production buckets (i.e., CURATED). This script is only run for Minor and Major releases. It also applies the appropriate permissions to the buckets (e.g., adding Verily's ASAP Cloud Readers to released raw buckets) and removes the `internal-qc-data` label from the released raw buckets. |
| [`markdown_generator.py`](./markdown_generator.py) | Functions that generate a Markdown report. | This script is used in the [`promote_staging_data`](./promote_staging_data) script to generate a Markdown report that contains data integrity results when trying to promote data from staging (i.e., DEV/UAT) to production buckets (i.e., CURATED). |

## Deprecated util scripts

| Script | Description | Context |
| [`transfer_raw_data`](./transfer_raw_data) | Transfer data in generic raw buckets to dataset-specific raw buckets (e.g., `gs://asap-raw-data-team-lee` vs. `gs://asap-dev-team-lee-pmdbs-sn-rnaseq`. | Originally, "generic" raw buckets were created because we only had one data type (i.e., sc RNAseq). Later on, we started implementing new data types (e.g., bulk RNAseq, spatial transcriptomics, etc.) and restructured the bucket naming and organization. Therefore, this script is used to move raw data from the generic raw buckets to data-specific raw buckets. It is not applicable to new datasets where we collaborate with the CRN Teams to determine the dataset name. |

Note: Previous Minor Releases did not contain pipeline/curated outputs (SOW 2); however, moving forward there will be outputs (SOW 3 - onwards) [06/12/2025]. Minor Releases apply to both diagrams, as some datasets may include either pipeline/curated outputs depending on the data modality. If a dataset was previously released in an Urgent or Minor Release and is later scheduled for a Major Release, the curated buckets will be overwritten with the most recent version of the data.
